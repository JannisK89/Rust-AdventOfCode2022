# Rust-AdventOfCode2023
Advent Of Code 2023 solutions in Rust for some basic Rust hands on action. 
Will propably not finish the whole thing since it get's a bit repetetive 
after a while.


## Are these good solutions?
No, I'm just doing these while reading the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)
to put the things I'm learning to use. They could definetly be solved 
in more efficient and prettier ways.
